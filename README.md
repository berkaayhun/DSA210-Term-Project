# DSA210-Term-Project
##1. Project Overview

This project aims to analyze how various factors such as education, experience, and personal skills influence individuals’ career satisfaction.
Career satisfaction (measured on a 1–10 scale) represents how fulfilled and content people feel with their professional lives, considering aspects such as salary, work-life balance, and growth opportunities.

The project will use machine learning models — mainly regression-based approaches — to predict Current Satisfaction and identify which factors have the most significant impact.
The analysis will also include feature engineering and hypothesis testing to ensure interpretability and meaningful insights.
